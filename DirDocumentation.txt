Toxikon Chemical Tracking System (CTS)
http://cts.toxikon.com/CTS
http://cts.toxikon.com/CTSDev
.NET MVC Project    

The project, originally created for Robert Gaudet, was discontinued after Robert left Toxikon.  It was meant for health and safety to have a nice system for tracking chemicals in the labs.  It is viable in its current form, although there was a push to add barcode scanning functionality.  That functionality was never completed. 

There's a CTS dev site as well as the production.  The production application is currently functional, however if I remember correctly there was an issue with data being erased after a certain amount of time (realized this after checking in on it once the project was cancelled).

Main Requirements:
Need to set up user authentification and authorization

To Improve:

Add form validation both client and server side for the new chemicals and updates
Smooth out UI, particularly for edit and create
Put the upload document on the same view/form as the rest of the create form
